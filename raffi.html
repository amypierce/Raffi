        <h1>Raffi's First Web Page</h1>
        
        <p>I have an 8 month old labrador puppy named Raffi. Actually his full registered name is Prince Rafael of Labrqadoria but it's easier to just call him Raffi or Raf.</p>
        <p>Raffi is not only sweet and smart but he's also beautiful. He's a "Fox Red" color, which means he's more of a rust-colored dog than a regular yellow lab.</p>

        <h2>Raffi's favorite toys:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Piggy</li>
            <li>Lamby</li>
            <li>Tennis ball</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Raffi's favorite foods:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Peanut butter</li>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Just about any food will do!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Stay tuned for plenty of cute photos!</p>
